# CRC-error-detecting-code
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. This project provide a C++ simulation for CRC.

HOW TO USE:

1)You choose the address of the source(sender)

2)You choose the adress of the destination(receiver)

3)You enter the data (with range from 1-1000)

4)It prints the data with errors on the screen
